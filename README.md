# Config
Firefox setup files with an edited [Cascade](https://github.com/andreasgrafen/cascade) and a custom new tab page.

Live [Preview](https://pyarya.github.io/firefox-css/) of new tab page.

# Setup
## cascade
Read the cascade github page(above) for information on editing and what to add
you can move the /chrome folder into your root profile directory (about:profiles) if you want the same setup as me.

## new tab
You can use the live preview as your new tab page if you dont want to change the colours or anything through your browser settings.
If you want to change the html and css:
    clone the repo/ download the zip and you can set up the browser to open the local file(index.html)
